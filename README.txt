adding enemies 
making spawning enemies

adding score manger 
making the eating behavior of the player
remaking half of the work from the last commit-the changes that i made was not saved nethier in my computer nor in github

------------------------
Spend two hours implementing the function that makes the player bigger when eating more enemies
I spent 6 hours creating the environment (I added borders to the segmentation area), this  helped me to solve the problem that enemies are scattered, so  the space seems to have no enemies, because we can fly in infinite space
----------------------------------------
spending 5 hours making infinitely scrolling background star space  
3 hours making the losing function and adding the scene of" game over" menu
